##Results and Key Insights
# Retailer Performance
Retailers play a significant role in driving sales revenue for SodaSpark. The analysis reveals that Sodapop is the clear leader among the company’s retail partners, generating a substantial $4.4 million in revenue. This figure accounts for more than half of the company’s total revenue, emphasizing Sodapop’s importance as a partner. The second-best performer is FizzySip, contributing $2.1 million, followed by BevCo with $1.3 million. In contrast, DreamCo significantly lags behind, producing only $0.4 million in revenue.
Key Insight: The dominance of Sodapop and FizzySip highlights their value as strategic partners. However, the underperformance of DreamCo raises concerns that warrant further investigation.

#Beverage Brand Performance
SodaSpark offers a range of beverages, but not all perform equally in the market. The analysis reveals:
•	Coca-Cola is the best-selling beverage, with 4 million units sold.
•	Dasani Water and Diet Coke are also strong performers, selling 2.9 million units each.
•	Brands such as Sprite, Fanta, and Powerade sell fewer units, with Sprite at 2.6 million, Fanta at 2.1 million, and Powerade at 2.0 million.
When comparing revenue, profit, and expenses across the beverage brands: Coca-Cola and Dasani Water contribute significantly to profit while maintaining low expenses. Powerade and Fanta, however, have lower profit margins due to higher relative expenses.
Key Insight: Beverages like Coca-Cola and Dasani Water are driving sales and profits for SodaSpark. Lower-performing beverages, particularly Powerade and Fanta, may require cost optimization.

#Sales Trends Over Time
The analysis of monthly revenue and expenses shows clear patterns: Revenue begins to climb in April and peaks during July and December. Expenses generally follow the same trend, increasing alongside revenue. This seasonal pattern suggests strong sales during mid-year (summer) and the holiday season, which aligns with typical consumer behavior for beverage purchases.
Key Insight: July and December represent peak sales opportunities for SodaSpark, likely driven by increased consumer demand during warmer months and the festive season.

#Regional and State-Level Performance
The regional analysis highlights significant differences in revenue contributions: The West region leads, accounting for 28.98% of total revenue. Other high-performing regions include the Northeast (21.47%) and the Southeast (19.65%). Regions such as the South (15.82%) and MIdWest (14.08%) underperform in comparison. The state-level revenue map further illustrates a concentration of sales in West and eastern states, aligning with the strong performance of the West region.
Key Insight: The West region is SodaSpark’s strongest market, generating nearly one-third of total revenue. Both the Northeast and Southeast regions also perform well, providing stable revenue streams. The South and Midwest regions underperform compared to others, representing opportunities for strategic growth. 

##Summary of Key Metrics
To summarize, the key figures from the analysis include:
•	Total Revenue: $8.17 million
•	Total Expenses: $1.75 million
•	Total Profit: $6.41 million
•	Top Retailer: Sodapop ($4.4 million in revenue)
•	Top Beverage: Coca-Cola (4 million units sold)
•	Top Region: West (28.98% of revenue)

##Recommendations
SodaSpark Beverages has demonstrated strong overall performance, driven by successful partnerships, best-selling products, and key regional markets. To build on this success and drive future growth, the following actions are recommended:
•	Retail Strategy: Maintain strong relationships with top retailers like Sodapop and work to improve the performance of DreamCo.
•	Product Focus: Prioritize high-performing beverages like Coca-Cola and Dasani Water while reducing costs for low-margin products.
•	Seasonal Planning: Prepare for peak demand in June and December with targeted campaigns and sufficient inventory.
•	Regional Growth: Expand efforts in underperforming regions (South and Midwest) while sustaining success in the West.
•	Expense Management: Identify opportunities to control costs, particularly during high-demand months, to maximize profit margins.
By implementing these strategies, SodaSpark can continue to grow its market presence, improve profitability, and maintain its position as a leading beverage brand.
